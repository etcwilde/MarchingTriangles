Marching Triangles

The algorithm describes a method of polygonizing an implicit surface by growing
triangles across the surface. The algorithm begins with a single triangle
placed on the surface, the picks an edge (two vertices on the triangle) and
finds one more vertex on the surface that is not within the triangle. With the
three vertices, it forms a new triangle. The selected edge is then removed from
the pool of edges and the two new edges are placed into the edge pool, then the
process repeats. Triangles are made as large as possible while keeping the
error under some small epsilon.
