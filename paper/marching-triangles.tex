\begin{abstract}
	In this paper, I describe a method of implementing the marching
	triangles algorithm. The marching triangles algorithm provides a
	technique of generating more-optimal triangulations of a surface, while eliminating some of the ambiguous cases seen in other algorithms.
	The marching triangle algorithm begins with a seed triangle and grows
	the mesh over an implicit surface in an iterative process. This allows
	the algorithm to generate a mesh that more closely represents the
	topology of the surface while minimizing polygons.

\section{Introduction}
Implicit surfaces (iso-surface) provide a method to store complex geometry or
geometry that cannot be generated in an explicit manner. Iso-surfaces are used
to specify arbitrary objects and geometry, which is useful for many
applications in physical simulations. It is also useful in the games industry
to show large amounts of detail, in a landscape for example, without storing
large amounts of data.

While iso-surfaces contain data accurately, computers have difficulty
representing them in a visual manner. An iso-surface is rendered in one of two
ways, ray-tracing, or polygonization followed by some rasterizer.

Even with current hardware and raytracing algorithms, raytracers are unable to
produce images quickly enough for interactive or real-time rendering of
implicit surfaces.

Currently, a very popular polygonization algorithm is the Marching Cubes, which
fills the universe with voxels, determines how the surface intersects each
voxel, and results in a plane within the voxel. This results in triangles which
are non-optimal to the topology of the surface, furthermore, there are
ambiguous cases where geometry is lost or cracks emerge.

An ideal polygonization would meet the following criteria:
it would produce a mesh that does not distort triangles, that is there are no
triangles that are long and narrow; it would produce triangles small enough
that no features of the surface are lost; smooth, flat, surfaces would not be
broken into more triangles than necessary; the mesh should not have holes or
disconnected vertices.

The Marching Triangles (MT) algorithm has the potential to create such a
polygonization. The marching triangles is an incremental algorithm that uses
the curvature of the surface to determine where new vertices are placed, either
creating larger triangles where the curvature is small, or creating smaller
triangles where the curvature is large.

In this paper, I investigate the implementation of the marching triangles
algorithm presented by Samir Akkouche and Eric Galin in \textit{Adaptive
Implicit Surface Polygonization using Marching Triangles} to see if the
marching traingles is a viable algorithm in practice.


\section{Related Work}

Samir Akkouche and Eric Galin present an implementation of the marching
triangles algorithm that is generalized for closed implicit surface manifolds.
It provides a topologically correct and geometrically accurate triangle mesh.

Their results suggest that the marching triangles algorithm runs in comparable
time to the marching cubes polygonization algorithm, and that the resulting
triangle mesh has higher visual appeal and better overall quality due to the
triangle size adapting to the curvature of the surface.

\section{Marching Triangles Algorithm}
The marching triangles algorithm creates a seed triangle and adds the three
edges to an edge pool. Then it selects one of the edges at random then
generates a new vertex in the direction of the gradient. If the curvature is
too great, the vertex will be brought closer to the selected edge, otherwise it
will push the vertex away. Once the vertex is placed, two new edges are added
between the vertices of the selected edge and the new vertex to generate a new
triangle. Then the selected edge is removed from the edge pool. The process of
selecting an edge and new vertex continues until the surface is covered.

\section {Implementation}

\subsection{Delaunay Triangulation}
I began with an implementation of the Delaunay triangulation to look at
possible methods of triangulation. Because the triangulation runs on a
point-cloud it won't be useful in the generation of triangles in the mesh. It
may be useful to create a circumsphere that bounds the size of the triangle so
that a triangle will never be too long in relation to the width.
